## Datastructure and algorithm
 - math description
    - absolute value
    - arccosine / arcsine / arctangent (how to achieve)
    - retangular coordinate / polar coordinate
    - cube root / square root (how to achieve)
    - exp() (how and description)
    - hypot(x, y) (avoid overflow and underflow)
    - natural logarithm base (E)x (log) (how)
    - positive / negative infinity
    - random number
    - rounded to (how) round()
    - sign of x signum()
    - hyperbolic sine / tangent
    - in radians / in degrees
    - unit of least precision / distance between this and next larger value in magnitude
